# MagAO-X irqbalanc configuration
#
# Edit the IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS bitmask to match the r/t cpusets created in rtc_cpuset
#
# Edit the IRQBALANCE_ARGS list of args to add a --banirq=x for each irq x you want to prevent being balanced
# 
# To Install:
#
# If first time after new installation: $ cp /etc/sysconfig/irqbalance /etc/sysconfig/irqbalance.bup
#
# $ systemctl stop irqbalance
# $ cp /opt/MagAOX/source/MagAOX/rtSetup/rtc/irqbalance /etc/sysconfig/irqbalance
#
# Now install magaorx_irqpolscript in /usr/local/bin and set selinux to allow
# irqbalance to run it:
# $ semanage permissive -a irqbalance_t
#
# Then start irqbalance:
# $ systemctl start irqbalance
# $ systemctl status irqbalance
# 


# irqbalance is a daemon process that distributes interrupts across
# CPUS on SMP systems. The default is to rebalance once every 10
# seconds. This is the environment file that is specified to systemd via the
# EnvironmentFile key in the service unit file (or via whatever method the init
# system you're using has.
#
# ONESHOT=yes
# after starting, wait for a minute, then look at the interrupt
# load and balance it once; after balancing exit and do not change
# it again.
#IRQBALANCE_ONESHOT=

#
# IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS
# 64 bit bitmask which allows you to indicate which cpu's should
# be skipped when reblancing irqs. Cpu numbers which have their
# corresponding bits set to one in this mask will not have any
# irq's assigned to them on rebalance
#
IRQBALANCE_BANNED_CPUS=00,fffc000f,ffffc000

#
# IRQBALANCE_ARGS
# append any args here to the irqbalance daemon as documented in the man page
#
IRQBALANCE_ARGS=--policyscript=/usr/local/bin/magaox_irqpolscript
