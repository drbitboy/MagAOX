To build a single test, from inside the `tests` subfolder, run 
\verbatim
$ make -B -f Makefile.one t=../apps/zaberCtrl/tests/zaberCtrl_test.cpp
$ ../apps/zaberCtrl/tests/zaberCtrl_test
\endverbatim
which shows how to build the test suited defined in \ref zaberCtrl_test.cpp.  Note that the `.cpp` is not required.  The `-B` switch
for make is not always necessary, but is a good idea to make sure the right things get built.  If you have only edited the `*_test.cpp`
file you can leave `-B` out.

To build all the tests:
\verbatim
$ make
\endverbatim
possibly with the `-B` flag.

Then to run all tests:
\verbatim
$ bash ./testMagAOX.bash
\endverbatim
